The MVP Studio process is unique and based on agile development. This process is split into phases:

**_Proposal and project goals:_**
 - Is the problem understood?
 - Is there an MVP that can be delivered within 3 months?
 - Are there key stakeholders involved throughout the process?
 - Is there a support plan?
 - What is the budget?

**_Development:_**
- Discovery : steps to understanding the problem
- Prioritization : identify the must-haves to solve the problem
- Wire-framing : priorities are defined and a mock-up begins of application
- Development : developers begin building the vision

**_Hand-off:_**
- The sprints have ended and there is a working application that showcases your vision

**_Support(there are two options):_**
