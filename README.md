# MVPStudio
MVP Studio will solve two local community problems/needs: 
 1. MVP Studio is working with civic groups to help them learn how to own a software project and to deliver a post Hack for a Cause product that civic groups champion to better serve community members. 
 2. MVP Studio is working with under-employed developers and interns to help them gain industry experience building and shipping a product.
